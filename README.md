## Index Fund Protocol

Create or Invest in funds and let the experts make profits while you're sleeping. Deposit $APT to a fund of your liking, protocol swaps $APT to other tokens and gives you an proportionate amount of Index tokens to represent your share. You can withdraw your money plus your profits at any time by selling your Index tokens share.
